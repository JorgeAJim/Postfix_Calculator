**** This and most other of my repos will get their README update in the future on how the algorithm works and how I implemented my solution****

This is the third project from my CSCI 36300, Software Design, couse taken at IUPUI (Fall, 2023). The purpose of this project is to use the software design patterns
(command pattern, abstract factory pattern, and iterator pattern) to create a calculator that can do: basic math, operator priority, and parenthesis. This project
managed to accomplish all requirements, however, there is some code that needs to be reworked and some optimizations that can be made. Although, there is some bad
design, the overall design of the program is solid and allows for the program to grow without needing to rework the design.

The "bad" design are just some methods that the professor stated can be made more efficient. As I rework the code, I will update the program to incorporate any improvements 
mentioned by the professor. 

*** The makefile for this project was not allowed to be submitted along side the rest of the code, as the professor had his own makefile to use. I will provide a Makefile as I work to improve 
the program ***
